# A Multi-Modal Framework for Autonomous Game Content Generation

This project aims to autonomously generate game content by integrating large language models, text-to-image, and text-to-3D technologies with voxel game engines. Harness the power of AI to automatically design, prototype, and integrate game assets.

## Background

Modern game design often involves manual labor for asset generation and integration. By leveraging recent advancements in AI, this project seeks to streamline the process and allow for dynamic game content creation based on textual descriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vipbasil/generative-survival-voxel.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd generative-survival-voxel
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide step-by-step examples of how to use the project.

```bash
# noa-examples



To build and serve the examples locally:

```sh
# (clone this repo)
cd generative-survival-voxel
npm install
npm test      # serves demos on localhost:8080
npm start     # serves demos in prod mode
```

Then open `localhost:8080` to view the three demos.

There's also a `build` script to generate all bundles into the `docs` directories, using `vite`. If you prefer `webpack`, the hello-world demo has a sample [webpack config](src/hello-world/webpack.config.js).

Those using React may want to check [@MCArth/noa-cra-example](https://github.com/MCArth/noa-cra-example), which is a ported noa example built with `create-react-app`.

## Dependency / build notes

### Babylon dependency:

`Noa` uses [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for 3D rendering, but references it as a peer dependency (so that game worlds can specify their Babylon version/modules). This means game worlds should declare a dependency on `@babylonjs/core` or similar, rather than loading in a prebuilt babylon script.

### noa dependency:

This engine is under active development. The current release is available from npm as `noa-engine`, but if you want the latest changes may want to change your `package.json` to point to the `#develop` branch on github:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "noa-engine": "github:fenomas/noa#develop",
  },
```

Or, if you want to hack on both the engine and a game world together, it's easiest to clone the [noa](https://github.com/fenomas/noa) repo alongside to this one, and then edit `package.json` to reference your local copy of the engine:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "noa-engine": "file:../noa",
  },
```

Note that after changing `package.json` you'll need to run `npm i`.

# Example command to run the application
python main.py --input "description of the game asset you want to generate"
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Game Asset Creation:** Generate 2D and 3D game assets from textual descriptions.
- **Voxel Game Engine Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the generated assets into the Noa voxel game engine.
- **Leveraging Text-to-Image Models:** Use the Stable Diffusion model to convert text descriptions into detailed images.
- **Advanced 3D Model Generation:** Utilize the OpenAI Shap-E model to transform text descriptions into complex 3D structures.
