# A Multi-Modal Framework for Autonomous Game Content Generation

This project aims to autonomously generate game content by integrating large language models, text-to-image, and text-to-3D technologies with voxel game engines. Harness the power of AI to automatically design, prototype, and integrate game assets.

## Background

Modern game design often involves manual labor for asset generation and integration. By leveraging recent advancements in AI, this project seeks to streamline the process and allow for dynamic game content creation based on textual descriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vipbasil/generative-survival-voxel.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd generative-survival-voxel
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide step-by-step examples of how to use the project.

```bash
# Example command to run the application
python main.py --input "description of the game asset you want to generate"
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Game Asset Creation:** Generate 2D and 3D game assets from textual descriptions.
- **Voxel Game Engine Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the generated assets into the Noa voxel game engine.
- **Leveraging Text-to-Image Models:** Use the Stable Diffusion model to convert text descriptions into detailed images.
- **Advanced 3D Model Generation:** Utilize the OpenAI Shap-E model to transform text descriptions into complex 3D structures.
