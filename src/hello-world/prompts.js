      "prompt": "Your task is to generate a JavaScript array of 11 unique materials for a voxel-based game world using the provided array template. The materials should be distributed across the game world's depth, which ranges from -64 (the deepest point) to 0 (the surface).\nEach material object in the array will have the following properties:\n- name: This is a string that represents the common name of the material.\n- min_height and max_height: These are numerical values that represent the minimum and maximum depths at which the material can be found in the game world. The values range from -64 (deepest) to 0 (surface). You should assign these values based on real geological layers. For example, bedrock should be at the greatest depths while soil and grass should be at the surface.\n- materialIds: This is a string that serves as a unique identifier for the material. Typically, it matches the material's name.\n- probability: This is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that represents the chance of finding the material within its height range in the world.\n- properties: This is an object that includes the material's characteristics:\n  - transparency: This is a numerical value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means the material is completely opaque and a value of 1 means it is completely transparent.\n  - shining: This is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that represents how shiny the material is. A value of 0 means the material is not shiny at all and a value of 1 means it is very shiny.\n  - liquid: This is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that represents the state of the material. A value of 0 means the material is solid and a value of 1 means it is liquid.\n  - durability: This is a numerical value between 1 and 100. A value of 1 means the material is very fragile and a value of 100 means it is very durable.\n  - color: This is an array of three numerical values between 0 and 1. They represent the Red, Green, and Blue color values of the material.\n  - texture: This string describes the material's texture in a visually detailed manner. Use rich, vibrant language and color-based adjectives to give a clear picture of the texture's appearance. For example, \"A rough, dark gray texture interspersed with glints of shiny black speckles,\" could be used to describe a granite-like material. This description will aid in the automatic texture generation process, helping to produce more accurate and visually pleasing results.\nYou need to fill in the template with appropriate values for each of these properties for every material. Ensure that you follow a logical order for the geological layers and provide a range of different materials and properties to create a rich and diverse game world."
